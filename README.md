# Java-Checkers-Final-Project
Mrs. Rio's APCSA Final Project Semester 2
Hello Welcome to my Java Final Proejct. For this project I have decided to make a Checkers Game. To play this game thier will be 2 players. A red player and a white player.
You can move your pieve by typing the coords of the piece you want to move and the coords on where you want it to go. For example thier is a piece on a3 and I want to move
it to b4. When I is my turn I would put a3 b4. The objective of this game is to take away your opponents pieces. For details and questions will be addressed at the start of
the game. The speical feature of my project is the navigating pieces system. It is simple to understand. Thank you for looking at my game and have fun.
